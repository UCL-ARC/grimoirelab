# GrimoireLab 1.17.0-rc.1
The following list describes the changes by component:

## grimoirelab-toolkit 1.2.0-rc.1 - (2025-10-10)

**New features:**

 * Identity management functions\
   Introduce a new module for managing identities. It includes functions
   to generate a UUID based on identity data and to convert Unicode
   strings to their unaccented form.

  ## kidash 1.1.1-rc.1 - (2025-10-10)
  
  * Update Poetry's package dependencies
## sortinghat 1.12.0-rc.1 - (2025-10-10)

**New features:**

 * Merge identities when adding a LinkedIn profile (#987)\
   When a user tries to add a LinkedIn identity that already exists to a
   profile, the user interface now offers the option to merge the
   identities.
 * Redirect to the original URL after user inactivity (#995)\
   After logging in, users are now redirected to the page they were
   visiting when they were logged out due to inactivity.
 * Improved UI for merge recommendations\
   The user interface now shows more than one merge recommendation at a
   time, and recommendations for an individual are now grouped so they
   can be managed in batches.

**Bug fixes:**

 * Remove multiple LinkedIn identities (#1008)\
   The user interface became stuck when multiple individuals  were
   removed using the option 'Remove Linkedin profile' on the individuals
   view.
 * GraphQL task_id type changed and interval value conversion\
   Updated task_id fields in DeleteScheduledTask and UpdateScheduledTask
   to use graphene.ID() instead of graphene.Int(). In Graphene v3, this
   caused type errors because a string value was being passed instead of
   an integer. Also converted interval values to numbers in the
   ImporterModal and SettingsGeneral components to prevent similar type
   errors, since Graphene v3 expects numeric values instead of strings.
 * Error of duplicated identities fixed during the import\
   Duplicated identities found during the import process weren't property
   handled which made the process to stop with an exception.
 * Importer job rescheduled fixed\
   Fixes a bug that caused the importer to always use the same start date
   when importing identities after being rescheduled. It now uses the
   start date of the current job as from_date for the next execution.
 * Case-insensitive matching for criteria\
   Convert the matching criteria to lowercase. This allows for case-
   insensitive comparisons, improving the matching accuracy.
 * Table showing jobs failing for offset-naive datetimes\
   Showing jobs in the table combining scheduled jobs and one-time jobs
   failed.

## cereslib 1.1.1-rc.1 - (2025-10-10)

**Bug fixes:**

 * Time zone for Git aoc study updated\
   In Git areas of code study use the time zone (`tz` field) from the
   author date instead of the committer date to be the same as Git index
   dates. Also include `committer_tz` in the index so it is available if
   needed.


## perceval 1.4.0-rc.1 - (2025-10-10)

**New features:**
